# Faulty Network Simulator

Created by: Rubi Dionisio and Alejandro Mozqueda

## Project Description

This project is meant to simulate a mesh network in which nodes and links may fail intermittently. Each node and link will have a certain probability to fail, when a fail does occur, the network must re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

This is the description for the UNR class CPE 400 project labeled as Dynamic Routing Mechanism Design in Faulty Network.
